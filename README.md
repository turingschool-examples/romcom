# RomCom  

### Abstract:
There's not enough romance novels in the world! We have created a random generator webapp to satisfy this market need. 
#### Features:
- Have a romance novel cover idea? No problem! Just go to the "Make Your Own Cover" page and fill out the form!
- No creative ideas? Just hit the "Show Random Cover" button!
- Like the cover you generated? Just hit the "Save Cover" button and view all your romance novel dreams by clicking the "View Saved Covers" button!
- Almost like what you see? You can edit each individual element (cover, title, tagline) by clicking and editing in your own ideas!

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
1. Write clean, DRY JavaScript
    - Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP and purity
    - Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
2. Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    - Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
3. Write code collaboratively
    - Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
    - Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
    - Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
#### Wins:
1. IT WORKS!!!!!!
2. Communication - as partners, we communicated our time availablity and stuck to our norming contract.
3. Project grooming - making tickets and prioritizing.

#### Challenges:
1. Merge Conflicts - new concept that we walked through together to ensure successful resolution.
2. Balancing time between writing code, refactoring, and learning new concepts entirely (.innerHTML, try...catch, prompt, .tagName, new URL(), event.preventDefault()).
