# RomCom

## Project Overview

  The goal for RomCom was to integrate skills acquired over the last 2 weeks to create a Browser app that can randomly generate romance covers with randomly assigned names and taglines. To complete this project we employed a working knowledge of JavaScript fundamentals, the DOM, event listeners, and event handlers. During this project we dove head first into HTML and CSS and acquired a working proficiency in querying DOM elements and manipulating those same elements. We gained skills in using JS Classes to create instances and pass in dynamic parameters and arguments.

When opening the app, you will be taken to the home view. On this page, you will see a randomly generated cover with random title and tagline. You can click the "Show New Random Cover" button to generate a new random cover. If a particular cover strikes your fancy, click the "Save Cover" button to save it. You can click the "View Saved Covers" button to see all of your currently saved covers.

This form will allow you to create a custom cover to your specifications. Simply add a link to the image of your choice in the Cover field, then add a title and two descriptors for your tagline. After all forms are filled, click the "Make My Book" button to view your new creation.\
