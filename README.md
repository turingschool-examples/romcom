### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
-Write clean, DRY JavaScript
-Build out functionality using functions that show trends toward SRP
-Manipulate the page after it has loaded adding, removing, and updating elements on the DOM
-Explore the connection between HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
-Practice reading, understanding, and using provided code
-Write code collaboratively
-Document changes with atomic commits & thorough code reviews
-Communicate, troubleshoot, and plan effectively as a team
-Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project

TECH used: GitHub, VScode, Command line (terminal), google and youtube for research.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
Wins:
-We were able to try different types of collaboration and find what worked best.
-Combining what we found in research to make the code run!

Challenges:
-One of the biggest challenges was being able to figure out what to do when stuck. This project really helped to practice effective googling, and reaching out to our other cohort mates, rocks, and mentors for guidance.
-Another challenge was being on different levels of understanding of the concepts used in this project, we learned that when the partner that has a better understanding navigates while the other drives it helps to deepen comprehension for both.
