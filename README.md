# RomCom

## Overview

There is an insatiable demand for romance novels and the publishing industry cannot keep up with demand. To alleviate this issue, software developers Nikki Balmoori and Ross Landino created RomCom in order to provide romance novel writers with fresh and interesting book ideas to increase the production of new novels.  This application uses javascript, HTML and CSS technologies to generate potential book covers for writers to use as inspiration for new novels.
