-   When the  **Make Your Own Cover**  button is clicked, the form is shown and the main view is hidden.
-   When the  **View Saved Covers**  button is clicked, the saved covers area is shown and the main cover is hidden.
-   When the  **Home Button** is clicked, only the home view is shown.
-   On the make your own cover form view, users can fill out the four input fields and click the  **Make My Book** button. The submitted data is saved so that future random covers can use the user-created data.
