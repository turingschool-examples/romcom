# RomCom

RomCom is a website that will aid you in creating cheap, original Mass Market Paperback romance novel covers. There is a random function to mash together some elements that we've already included or you can enter your own on a provided form. If there is one you like, you can save it to be compared to other ones that you generate.

##Requirements

You will need an internet browser to use RomCom

##Installation

The program can be forked/cloned at https://github.com/bpeterson2579/romcom, but you probably knew that since that's probably how you found it :)
