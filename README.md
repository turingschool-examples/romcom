A boilerplate repo. 

## Set Up
1. ONE teammate: fork this boilerplate repository 
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal
6. Add all project partners and your assigned instructor as collaborators on the repository

You will not need to worry about importing/exporting the arrays from the data.js file because they are linked via the script in the `index.html` file.

# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

We made a magical book cover generator for romantic comedies. it can create random book covers for you or you can make your very own by choosing an image and adding a title and a couple of lines to describe your story. If you genarate or create a cover you really like you can save it to see later view all the saved covers whenever you want. it's like having your own personal library of cool RomCom book covers!!!!

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:

We started on Wenesday and pretty much workd on every second every until it was due on sunday at 9pm. It was really hard. We are 2 weeks into the Program.

### Contributors:

Laura Long and Fotis Kousiakis (he did most of the work)
 
### Learning Goals:

We were evaluated on the following conepts:
* JavaScript
* Workflow & Professional Habits
* Reading Code
* Functionality

### Wins + Challenges:
Wins
Our communication and collaboration was on point. We were both very committed to getting it done and had a good time doing it. Fotis maintained a very positive attitude the whole time which kept our boat afloat.. Laura on the other hand... 
Another win is getting the code to work even though we barely know what we're doing still.
We also saw some MAJOR improvement of our skills and understanding of JavaScript! YAY

Challenges
We struggled quite a bit on most things... but overcame them! 
As beginner developers it was *very* challenging to comprehend and modify such complex JavaScript effectively. It took forever to get our code to run the way we wanted to. Specifically finishing iteration 2 and 3.
GitHub workflow was confusing.
