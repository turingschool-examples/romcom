### Abstract:

This Application allows the user to view, create, and save / delete book covers. All book covers have their own cover image, title, and subtitles. 

Upon loading the home page; a random cover with a random title and description will be displayed. The user can cycle through randomized books with the "Show New Random Cover" button. The user can go back to the home page at any time by clicking the "Home" button.

User can save any book currently displayed on the home page by clicking the "Save Cover" button. The saved cover(s) can be viewed by navigating to the "View Saved Covers" section. Duplicate covers will not be saved.

User can delete any saved book by double clicking the book they wish to delete.

Navigating to the "Make Your Own Cover" section will present a form to the user. Fill out the form with your own cover, title, and descriptor words. Click the "Make My Book" button to create the book with these values and display it on the home page. 

**note: please use .jpg urls for your cover image!**

Values used to create custom books will be added to the "Show New Random Cover" functionality!

5. Learning how to use and create event listeners / handlers.
6. Learning what is involved in the functionality of a website.

Tech we used: MacBook Pro, Git, GitHub, VSCode, MacOS Terminal, Chrome Browser, Chrome Dev Tools, Zoom, Slack.

### Wins + Challenges:

##### WINS:

Patrick - My biggest win was that I put in enough time to work on the project effectively even though I was on my first Las Vegas vacation.

Zen - My biggest win is the fact that we completed the entire project with proper functionality.

Both - We are very happy about how much better we got at working together throughout our time working on the project.

##### CHALLENGES / OVERCOMING THEM:

Patrick - A challenge I faced was that alot of the concepts we had to use to get the code to work are certainly beyond my current understanding. 
When we found a solution it was hard for me to move on because I wanted to understand WHY the code we wrote is working. 
I solved this challenge by accepting there are things I don't know yet, and that is OK. I just need to spend some time to learn / practice them. 
There was certainly a severe lack of sleep for me this weekend, Zen did a good job of checking in on me and making sure I took breaks when needed!

Zen - My biggest challenge was adding the current cover to the savedCovers array, and ensuring that duplicates were not added into the savedCovers array. To get out of the hole I got outside help from a software engineer.
