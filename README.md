# RomCom: Paired Project

## Overview:

This was our first paired project as part of the Turing Front-End coding program.

We created a website that allows the user to generate romance novel covers. We wrote it using Javascript that integrated in HTML and CSS files provided to us by Turing.

The site allows the user to:

* Generate a random novel cover (both upon page load and button-click)
* Generate a custom novel cover using form input fields
* Save either a random or custom novel cover (without creating duplicates)
* Display the collection of saved covers
* Delete an individual saved cover upon double click

## Generate a Random Cover:

The website will generate a random cover upon page-load and each unique refresh. If a user wants to generate a random cover they can also click the "Show New Random Cover" button.

## Generate a Custom Novel Cover:

A user can also design their own novel covers. To do this a user will:

1. Click "Make Your Own Cover"
2. Provide a image address, title, and two descriptors in the respective input fields
3. Click "Make My Book"
4. Feast their eyes upon the glory of their creation

In addition to generating the user's custom cover, this form will also save each constituent piece in their respective arrays. This allows for future clicks of "Show New Random Cover" to display their suggestions.

## Save Novel Cover:

A user can save either a custom or randomly generated cover by clicking the "Save Cover" button. This will save the cover currently displayed, and allow them to see their favorites later by clicking the "View Saved Covers" button.

If a user wishes to remove a saved cover, they can do so by double clicking the cover that has fallen out of favor.

## Future Features:

* Shows larger cover model on click of a saved cover
* The ability for changes to persist upon page reload
* Allows user to rearrange saved covers as they wish
