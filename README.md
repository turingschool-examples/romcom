### Abstract:

# Application allows user to create book cover with a unique cover image, title, and subtitle. On the home page when the user clicks the "Show New Random Cover" button a random cover with a random title and subtitle will be displayed. The user can save that cover with the save cover button. The user can view the save cover(s) by clicking the "View Saved Covers" button. The user can make their own custom cover by clicking the "Make Your Own Cover" button completing the form input fields and clicking the "Make My Book" button. The values from the input fields will be saved and if the user goes back to the home page then clicks the "Show New Random Cover" button those values can possible be used to generate a random cover.

### Context:
My partner and I worked on the project for ~16 hours. We are both two weeks into Module 1 at Turing School of Software and Design.

### Contributors:
https://github.com/zenmcmillan - Zen McMillan
https://github.com/pitter3 - Patrick Eitel


### Learning Goals:
1) Learning how to work on a paired project effectively.
2) Learning how to utilize the Git / GitHub workflow with a partner.
3) Learning how to work with the data model and the DOM.
4) Bugtesting / Version Control.
5) Learning how to use and create event listeners / handlers.
6) Learning what is involved in the functionality of a website.

Tech we used: MacBook Pro, Git, GitHub, VSCode, MacOS Terminal, Chrome Browser, Chrome Dev Tools, Zoom, Slack.

### Wins + Challenges:
1) Patrick - My biggest win was that I put in enough time to work on the project effectively even though I was on my first Las Vegas vacation. 

2) Zen - My biggest win is the fact that we completed the entire project with proper functionality.

3) Both - We are very happy about how much better we got at working together throughout our time working on the project.

1) Patrick - A challenge I faced was that alot of the concepts we had to use to get the code to work are certainly beyond my current understanding. When we found a solution it was hard for me to move on because I wanted to understand WHY the code we wrote is working. I solved this challenge by accepting there are things I don't know yet, and that is OK. I just need to learn / practice them. There was certainly a severe lack of sleep for me personally this weekend, Zen did a good job of checking in on me and making sure I took breaks when needed. 

2) Zen - My biggest challenge was adding the current cover to the savedCovers array, and ensuring that duplicates were not added into the savedCovers array. To get out of the hole I got outside help from a software engineer.
