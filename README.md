A boilerplate repo. 

## Set Up
1. ONE teammate: fork this boilerplate repository

3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor
5. View the project in the browser by running open index.html in your terminal

You will not need to worry about importing/exporting pieces of code between files because they are linked via scripts in the `index.html` file.
