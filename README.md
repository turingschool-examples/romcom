# RomCom  

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Kyle and David worked on five iterations with specified features. To wit: 
1) Iteration 0 required functionality for a webpage that should randomly display a book title, cover, and tagline every time the page is refreshed. Then, we worked to arrange that functionality within a button in the header element of the DOM. 
2) Iteration 1 requested multiple features. Firstly, it required that the home page view, form page view, and saved covers view of the page were presented in a way that, in a nut, no one page would present all three forms at once. Secondly, it required functionality for additional event listeners on the page, and their representation on each form as well. 
3) Iteration 2 required a feature for creating one's own cover that included the four elements described above. 
4) Iteration 3 required a feature that allowed users to save and view their own covers randomly generated. 
5) Iteration 4 featured the ability for the user to delete saved covers one at a time. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
They merely need to clone our repo on github and open the index.html page in their browser. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
David and Kyle worked on this project for about 14-15 hours. We are both Mod 1, Week 2 Front End students.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
Our learning goals were to write clean, dry code, build functionality according to spec, broaden our understanding of the connections between HTML, JavaSript, and CSS, build on our professional development, and sharpen our habits with our workflow. 

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We had a major block on Iteration 3, and after over an hour of trial and error/MDN/ChatGPT/Google, we reached out to our cohort and our Rocks for help. Hearing their input was enlightening and it helped encourage us to keep going. Then, we realized there was an error in our logic and when we attempted to fix that directly, it worked! It was a great feeling to see our code meet the requirements in real time on the website.
