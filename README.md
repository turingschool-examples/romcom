# **Create your Own RomCom**

This project allows users to flip through a random collection of Romance Novels with unique cover images, titles, and descriptions. The user can also create their very own cover by adding in their own fields to the text boxes! The program allows users to save covers they particularly like, and delete them with a simple double click.
This Valentine’s Day, users can have some fun with our Romance Novel generator to create the perfect book for their loved ones!

# **Code Architecture**

This project consists of 5 different files - cover.js, data.js, index.html, styles.css, main.js.

- cover.js is the class that holds the data model.
- data.js holds all necessary information for the applications logic including arrays of : Cover images, titles, and descriptors.
- Main.js houses our JavaScript functionality

# **Code Example**

We had a function called `displaySavedCovers`, and created another one called `deleteSavedCover` to be able to delete a cover on a doubleclick event. Our event listener, `ondblclick`, is embedded in our HTML Section because we want to view our saved covers in the console log in their own section with the ID displaying. In the Elements area of the console log, there is no button that lets us delete, so we are forced to make each saved cover have its own id and section to be able to delete upon double click .

# **Extra Features**

We want our users to be able to know their selection is saved when they click save, or has already been saved, so we created an alert for the user’s sanity for each action.
